# HealthCare Dashboard Project

Welcome to the **Healthcare Pharma Dashboard** project. This repository contains a powerful Tableau dashboard designed to provide deep insights into healthcare operations, financial performance, and patient statistics.

## 📊 Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze the performance of various healthcare departments and regions. By leveraging key metrics—such as patient count, revenue, expenses, and profit—stakeholders can identify trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for growth.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`HealthCare Dashboard.twb`**: The interactive Tableau Workbook containing the dashboard and individual analytical sheets.
- **`Healthcare.xlsx`**: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
- **`Harshil pmms report.pdf`**: A comprehensive PDF report summarizing the findings and methodology.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## 📈 Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides the following visualizations and insights:

1.  **Overview KPIs**: At-a-glance summary of Total Patients, Total Revenue, Average Treatment Cost, and Profit.
2.  **Temporal Trends**: Line charts visualizing the fluctuation of patient numbers and revenue over time (Monthly/Yearly).
3.  **Regional Analysis**: Breakdowns of performance metrics across different geographic regions.
4.  **Departmental Performance**: Comparative analysis of departments (e.g., Surgery, Consultation) to see which drives the most revenue or incurs the highest costs.
5.  **Treatment Type Distribution**: Insights into the volume and profitability of different treatment types (e.g., Medication, Therapy).
6.  **Cost vs. Revenue**: Detailed view of Expenses vs. Revenue to calculate Profit margins.
